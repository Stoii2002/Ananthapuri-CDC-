                                    <p className="sec-textmb-30">Autism Spectrum Disorder, which is a neurological and developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact with others. Autism is recognised as a “developmental disorder” even though a diagnosis can be made at any age. This is because the majority of symptoms usually appear in the first two years of life. The neurological system is impacted by autism spectrum disorder, which also has an effect on the affected person’s general character and emotional, social, and physical health.</p>
                                    <p className="sec-textmb-30">The symptom’s scope and intensity can differ greatly. Common symptoms include repetitive activities, obsessions, trouble interacting with others, and trouble communicating. Early detection, behavioural, educational, and family therapy can all help to lessen symptoms and promote growth and education. Autism treatments are now available at every major hospital.</p>

                                    <h4 className="mb-20">What are the Symptoms of ASD?</h4>
                                    <p className="mb-35">In early infancy, some infants exhibit symptoms of an autism spectrum condition, including decreased eye contact, indifference to carers, or lack of responsiveness to their names. For some children, the first few months or years of their lives may be spent developing normally, but after that, they may abruptly lose linguistic abilities they have already learned or become reclusive or violent. Around age two, signs are typically noticed.</p>
                                    <p className="mb-35">Depending on the severity of their condition and their own behavioural patterns, children with autism spectrum disorder can range in functioning from low functioning to high functioning.</p>
                                    <p className="mb-35">A few percent of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder exhibit lower-than-normal intelligence, and some have difficulty with learning. Some children with the condition have normal to high intelligence; they pick things up fast but struggle with social situations, communication, and implementing what they learn.</p>
                                    <p className="mb-35">Determining the severity of a child’s symptoms might occasionally be challenging because of their individual blend. Usually, it depends on the severity of the impairments and how they affect one’s capacity to operate.</p>

                                    <h4 className="mb-20">What we provide in Ananthapuri CDC!</h4>
                                    <p className="mb-35">For many families, accepting an individual with autism presents a problem. It is imperative that acceptance start at home. Every member of society, aside from the autistic person’s family, is vital to the provision of a strong support network for autistic people. Here at Ananthapuri special school, we work hard to inform, acquaint, and empatheticate parents, siblings, grandparents, and carers with the various aspects of autism. This guarantees that the family, therapists, and special educators collaborate to bring forth the best in every child. </p>
                                    <p className="mb-35">Everyone can get a free assessment from Ananthapuri Child Development Centre. Occupational therapists, psychologists, and speech-language pathologists make up our evaluation team; each was chosen after a strict selection procedure. Standardised instruments are used to conduct assessments. Both parents and the child must be present for the assessment. It is necessary to bring all past medical records and any documentation of the child’s therapy sessions to the evaluation. Our team of professionals will evaluate the youngster and recommend a possible course of action.</p>
                                    <p className="mb-35">Children with mild to moderate symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) who may be able to attend a conventional school but may require assistance with socialisation, communication, deviant language, sensory issues, and other cognitive impairment are the target audience for this curriculum. While attending regular school, this course attempts to support these children with their fine and gross motor problems, language development, communication, and social interaction.</p>
