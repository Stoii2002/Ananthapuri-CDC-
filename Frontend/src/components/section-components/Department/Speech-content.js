                            <p className="mb-20">
                            Every child learns to speak at his own pace. As a parent If you have any concern about whether your child needs speech therapy or not, then it is absolutely normal to give a speech therapy session to your child. Even children who can talk and read at a very young age can also benefit from speech therapy. The sessions provided by our professional speech therapists in Trivandrum Ananthapuri Child Development Centre train your child not just about how to speak clearly but also in better use of the body language and gestures in order to communicate properly. Speech therapy ensures your child becomes more accurate in putting across his thoughts and ideas and becomes more efficient in conducting conversations and making new friends.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-20">But in some cases, your child needs speech therapy due to medical conditions. Injuries to the brain and infections or developmental disorders like Down syndrome can impact your child's ability to speak and cause problems with communication. In such cases, speech therapy can regain your ability to improve your child's communication skills.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-20">Identification of speech disability should occur at a very young age. Initiating speech therapy at a very young age will improve your child's chances of attaining their full potential for communication development.

                            <p className="mb-20">
                            Late talking can occur due to issues related to hearing or retardation in development. Your toddler would need speech therapy if he is not meeting the typical standards for speech development. Each child learns things at various paces, but we need to keep attention to their progress. Normally, if your child doesn't speak by 18-24 months or is less interested in talking, then he/she might be a late talker.
                            </p>

                            </h4>
                            <p className="mb-20">
                            Yes, they do! Most people assume that speech therapists only deal with improving communication. But in reality, they also address eating and swallowing issues. Kids suffering from speech difficulties frequently find it difficult to eat because they require exact tongue movement for both actions. Even kids who do not have speech disorders may sometimes have eating and swallowing difficulties.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-20">
                            Our speech therapists can help your child by giving them fun activities to develop the mouth muscles essential for eating and communication. This fun activity includes blowing toys or bubbles. Our speech therapy makes sure that your toddler is happy throughout the process.

                            <p className="mb-20">
                            There are kids who find it hard to communicate because of their health problems, so they need alternative methods.
