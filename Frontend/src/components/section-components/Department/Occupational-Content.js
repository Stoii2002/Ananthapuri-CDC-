                                    Occupational therapy is often mistaken for something related to career counseling. In fact, 
                                    occupational therapists are not worried about careers; they are focused on their work that 
                                    gives daily life meaning.</p>
                                    <p>Occupational therapy helps patients recover or develop skills required for the activities of daily 
                            living, including self-care, leisure, independent living and work. Therapists work in hospitals, in 
                            schools, in nursing homes and with patients in their own homes</p>
                            
                            <p>People who benefit from occupational therapy or OT, include those who have had autism, ADHD,

                                 with developmental delays.</p>
